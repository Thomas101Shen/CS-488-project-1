expected latency of h1-h4: 165ms
expected throughput of h1-h4: 20Mbits/sec

expected latency of h6-h6: 90ms
expected throughput of h5-h6: 5.29 Mbits/sec

Unless the packets that are going through interfer with each other route,
which I think it won't, the latency should stay the same as previous tests.
Throughput I believe is to be unchangeable simply because I'd like to think
of it as a limit/bandwidth.

Though, if the latency is changed, it'd be because the ping packets are
intefering with each other because the data of each packet are only big
enough for the throughput to only allow one at a time. Meaning to say, they
would be blocking each other.

The expected result was not what I was thinking it was.
The throughput of h5-h6 was increased to 25.4 Mbits/sec. And the latency of h5-h6
was faster.

My thinking is the switches saw an increase in traffic compared to the usual and
to not create bottlenecking/clogging of data it increased the bandwidth between
the links and in result of that decreased the latency allowing the h5-h6 packets
to travel faster.
